export const letter = `Dear Allyse,

Happy birthday! I can’t believe how wonderful and beautiful and amazing it’s been to have you in my life. I’ve learned so much from you. And there are no words or tokens or gestures or gifts that will ever be enough to express to you how I feel about you.

But I’m glad I get to try.

I will always want you to be happy and I know that you deserve it. From the bottom of my heart, I love you. I hope today’s birthday is/was/will be everything you want and more. And I hope life is the same for you too.

I can’t really think of much more to say for whatever, reason, so I guess I’ll leave it at this:

Beluga whales make a lot of noises actually and communicate with whistles and clicks and whatnots, earning them the nickname “sea canary”.

I want to “sea” your “canary”. Eh. Eh. EHHHH?!?!??!?!?!??!?!

Your OAI,


Gabe
